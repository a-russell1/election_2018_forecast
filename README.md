# election_2018_forecast

Here is my forecast:
  
Democrats will retake the House with gaining at least 26 seats in the election. Major party flips will occur in these districts:
  - Arizona 2nd: Ann Kirkpatrick (D) will defeat Lea Marquez Peterson (R)
  - California 45th: Katie Porter (D) will defeat incumbent Mimi Walters (R)*
  - California 49th: Mike Levin (D) will defeat Diane L. Harkey (R)
  - Iowa 1st: Abby Finkenauer (D) will defeat incumbent Rod Blum (R)*
  - Maine 2nd: Jared Golden (D) will defeat incumbet Bruce Poliquin (R)*
  - Michigan 11th: Haley Stevens (D) will defeat Lena Epstein (R)
  - Michigan 8th: Elissa SLotkin (D) will defeat incumbent Mike Bishop (R)
  - Minnesota 3rd: Dean Phillips (D) will defeat incumbent Erik Paulsen (R)*
  - Minnesota 2nd: Annie Craig (D) will defeat incumbent Jason Lewis (R)*
  - New Jersey 2nd: Jeff Van Drew (D) will defeat Seth Grossman (R)
  - Pennsylvania 5th: Mary Gay Scanlon (D) will defeat Pearl Kim (R)
  - Pennsylvania 7th: Susan Wild (D) will defeat Marty Nothstein (R)
  - Virginia 10th: Jennifer Wexton (D) will defeat incumbent Barbara Comstock (R)*

Toss-Up's to watch are:
  - New Jersey 3rd:
    - I predict neither Andy Kim (D) nor incumbent Tom MacArthur (R)* will get above 50% of the vote, with third party runner Lawrence Berlinski Jr. (Con.) getting at least 3% of the vote. Kim will beat out MacArthur marginally.
  - New York 22nd:
    - I predict this race will be within 2%, with Anthony Brindisi (D) taking the slight victory over incumbent Claudia Tenney (R)*
